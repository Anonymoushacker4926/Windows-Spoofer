Looking into the logs when you log into EFT and play I found what they do and are looking for exactly.

This means they check all of those, and if any of them match whats on their EFT Blacklist of BANNED players, you'll get banned instantly!
If you read it out too, you'll recongnize that they are selecting specific parts of it using "WMI requests" and selecting "'*' = everything"
FROM for ex. "Win32_BaseBoard" and all the info from it when it gets printed out basically. they aren't going for JUST the HWID's....
