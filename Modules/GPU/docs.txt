PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_1F08&SUBSYS_21673842&REV_A1\4&1C3D25BB&0&0019


PCI:
    This indicates that the device is connected to the PCI bus, which is a common interface for connecting various hardware devices to a computer.

VEN_10DE:
    This is the Vendor ID (VEN) part of the PNPDeviceID. In this case, "VEN_10DE" represents the Vendor ID for the device, and it corresponds to NVIDIA Corporation. The Vendor ID is a unique identifier assigned to hardware manufacturers.

DEV_1F08:
    This is the Device ID (DEV) part of the PNPDeviceID. "DEV_1F08" represents the specific device and its model. The Device ID is a unique identifier assigned to a particular device by the manufacturer.

SUBSYS_21673842:
    This represents the subsystem identifier, which provides additional information about the specific implementation or variant of the device. It helps distinguish between different versions or configurations of the same device model.

REV_A1:
    This indicates the revision or version of the device. In this case, "REV_A1" specifies revision A1.

4&1C3D25BB&0&0019:
    This is the instance-specific information. It contains details such as the bus number, device number, function number, and a unique identifier for the specific instance of the device on the system.

    4: Bus number (in hexadecimal).
    1C3D25BB: Device number and additional information.
    0: Function number.
    0019: Unique identifier for the specific instance of the device.

Putting it all together, the PNPDeviceID "PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_1F08&SUBSYS_21673842&REV_A1\4&1C3D25BB&0&0019" can be interpreted as a NVIDIA video controller device with a specific model and version, connected to the PCI bus, and having a unique identifier for its instance on the system.
